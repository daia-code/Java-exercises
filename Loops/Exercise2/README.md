Calculating the value of the CD) Suppose you put $ 10,000 in a CD with an annual percentage yield of 5.75%. After a month, the CD is worth it
10000 + 10000 * 5.75 / 1200 = 10047.91
After two months, the CD is worth it
10047.91 + 10047.91 * 5.75 / 1200 = 10096.06
After three months, the CD is worth it
10096.06 + 10096.06 * 5.75 / 1200 = 10144.43
and so on.
Write a program that asks the user to enter an amount (for example, 10000), the annual value
percentage yield (e.g. 5.75) and the number of months (e.g. 18) and displays a table, as shown in the sample.
